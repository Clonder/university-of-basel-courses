# Exam Preparation Guide: Key Questions and Recommendations

## Communication:

1. **How can one implement a reliable broadcast?**
   - Discuss the properties of reliable broadcast.
   - Compare different implementations (eager vs. lazy).
   - Provide an execution diagram to illustrate the differences.

2. **What is an event? What is the concurrency of events?**
   - Define what an event is.
   - Define concurrency between events.
   - Explain what sequential events are and how to ensure they are delivered in the correct order.

## Parallelization:

1. **What steps must be performed to parallelize a computational application?**
   - Recall the steps involved in parallelization.
   - Discuss factors that influence the process.
   - Highlight the differences between parallelization and distributed systems.

## Data:

1. **Describe the 3-Phase Commit (3PC) protocol.**
   - Discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

2. **What is k-connectivity and the degree of a P2P system?**
   - Provide examples and explain why these concepts are important in peer-to-peer networks.

3. **Compare Napster and Gnutella.**
   - Highlight the key differences between these P2P systems.

## Privacy:

1. **What are privacy by design principles?**
   - Provide real-world examples where these principles could have prevented privacy violations if they had been applied correctly.

2. **What is Homomorphic Encryption?**
   - Describe the differences between Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE), providing examples.

3. **Describe the Laplace and Exponential mechanisms.**
   - Explain the differences between these mechanisms with examples.

## Overall Recommendations:
- **Connect different parts:** Identify integrated concepts across different topics to develop a holistic understanding.
- **Teach someone else:** Find a peer or friend and explain the material to them. This will help solidify your understanding.
